      LIBRARY CHALLENGE:
      
      Write a small app to track the books in stock in a library. 
      
      There should be a form to add a new book (including title, author, year, and ISBN number), along with the number of copies of this book to add to the library's inventory. 
      
      Feel free to write this form directly into the HTML here, but your actual list of books should be generated by JavaScript.
      
      Your code should draw a list of books to the page
       * with one list item for each book
       * showing all of the data for the book (styled however you want)
       * including a count of how many copies are in the inventory
       * and how many copies are currently checked out
       * with links or buttons to:
          * increase or decrease the number of copies in the inventory
          * check out a copy of the book
          * check one copy back in (if any copies are checked out)
          * remove / delete the book entirely from the library

      There are detailed instructions in the `index.js` file on how to build the individual data structures and functions you will need.
      
      For your HTML, try to focus more on semantic structure than appearance or styling. It's okay for your app to look basic.
